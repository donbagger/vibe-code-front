## How It Works

This challenge is simple: start with our**starter repo**‚Äîit includes examples and helper functions so you can move fast. From there, build something genuinely useful on top of**DexPaprika**data.

Think beyond the basics. You could stream real‚Äëtime alerts, explore arbitrage opportunities, track new liquidity pools as they appear, or design tools that make portfolio decisions easier. If you already have an idea, use this as the backbone. If you don‚Äôt, experiment until something sparks.

The goal is to showcase an*innovative idea*powered by on‚Äëchain data‚Äîclean, focused, and practical. Keep it approachable for others to read and remix.
